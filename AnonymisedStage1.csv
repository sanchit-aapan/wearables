ID,Sex,Age,Surgery Status,Q1 - Wearables?,Q2 - Use in surgery?,Q3 - Advantages?,Q4 - Concerns?,Q5 - Perception?
1,M,48,Completed,Not sure,Surgeons can wear smart glasses - Not sure of use,Everything can be monitoredand standardised. Especially liked the idea of the glove.,No concerns,"Very good idea, everything is traceable, checked, safe."
2,M,59,Completed,Not sure,Glasses that help direct surgeons by overlaying information,Safetyimproved,"No - assuming if they are using it, it is mature and approved technology - not much room for error in surgery; maybe I'd be happy for them to trial it on my leg, but not my brain.",Not really
3,M,74,Completed,Not sure,"Not sure how, but sure they can help improve surgeries",Make surgeries quicker and more effective,Not comfortable with it - everything is changing very fast,No comment
4,M,33,Completed,Not sure,Give surgeons a clearer picture of what they’re looking at - augmented reality,Improvingpatient outcomes,Technology is generally very unreliable,More aware of it now.
5,M,74,Completed,Not sure,"""Glasses to give surgeons information about that they are looking at. Something hand-worn for guidance doing procedures e.g., if surgeon is approaching a danger zone it can let them know""",Result drivenso will be developed and continued only if helping the patients and the surgeons,Slight concern - but happy as long as the technology was good quality and tested,Didn’t know about them before.
6,M,77,Completed,Not sure,Not sure,Not sure,No concerns,No
7,M,51,Completed,Not sure,Glasses with zoom to get close up views,Improved outcomes. Anything that helpsreduce risk,"Hacking - if devices communicating using bluetooth not secure. Not affordable, increased cost of surgery. ",Not really - always had my doubts about technology.
8,M,45,Completed,"Hearing aids, amputee limbs - used to help people",Could be in a different country assisting another operation using a headset,Improved efficiencythrough remote guidancefrom experts - good use of their time. Generally improved reliability ,No concerns as long as technologies are proven and tested,Seeing futuristic technologies in a hospital gives patients confidence - it shows that you are striving for perfection and excellence. I think these technologies will save a lot of lives
9,M,78,Completed,Not sure,Allow surgeons to handle the problem better by seeing more information,Seems potentially very useful,No concerns,No - as still don’t understand very well
10,M,38,Completed,Not sure,Not sure,Seeing the scans is very useful.Pressure gloves are great to ensure not applying too much pressure,No concerns - apart from surgeons being inexperienced with tools,Learnt new use cases - hope they can help in the future
11,F,71,Awaiting,Not sure,Not sure,Precisecutting can be achieved with the gloves. Also great to speak to experienced surgeon,Depends on experience of using the technologies,No
12,F,63,Completed,Not sure,Not sure,Can make procedures more safe.,No concerns,Yes - think it’s a good thing
13,F,32,Awaiting,Not sure,Not sure,Must be costly to develop - and hence must be useful,Has the potential to go too far - don’t trust technology - as long as surgeon is comfortable and confident - don’t want to be a guinea pig,No
14,M,41,Awaiting,Things like headphones and smart watch,Not sure,"Computers are already doing a lot of surgical tasks that some years ago humans were doing - aim is to increase precision and accuracy, and wearables do this greatly","Concerned if technology is not working e.g., in a black out. Important to have a backup",Always saw it as an advantage but learnt new use cases
15,M,51,Completed,Not sure,Can attach a robot to surgeon's arm,Human can make mistake but computers make less -  Wearable can increase accuracyand make surgeries easier ,No concerns,No
16,M,76,Completed,Smart watches and fitness trackers,Can help advance microsurgery -wear something on the hand to help access small intricate spaces,Accuracy - computer calculates quicker and is more accurate. Headsetseems quite cool. Training - experienced surgeon can wear headset and trainees can watch an the procedure through surgeon's eyes,No concerns ,No change in perception 
17,M,36,Completed,Not sure,Glasses to add more data to what you're looking at,Enhancing surgeons skillsmaking it easier and safer ,No concerns as I have full belief ,Learnt new use cases 
18,M,77,Completed,Not sure,Not sure,Provides more infoduring procedure - good as a teaching and training aid,Good technology is also seen on wards but staff is always running around for batteries - general failure of technology and data sharing in the NHS - can be risky adding more technology ,Yes - more open to learning about new technologies - its important as its the future
19,M,52,Completed,Any bluetooth devices which you can wear,Not sure of uses but it is a double-edged sword - can help but can also be risky,It's cool,No issues - just dont want it to be gimmicky and don't want to be used as a guinea pig,Not a concept I'd heard of before 
20,M,32,Completed,Not sure,Smart glasses with inbuild microscope,Not sure,Glasses might obstruct vision and cause mistakes - wouldn't want it used on me ,Learnt something new
21,F,54,Completed,Not sure,"""To monitor the way the patient's body is behaving during without being invasive  (Patient misunderstood and was speaking about patient-worn wearables)""",Good for training to improve your skill whilst minimising harm. Sharing skills over call is also a great idea.,"Inability to trust technology, e.g., a self driven car - important to know if you can override it ",Good to know new things out there and important to share this information with others 
22,F,37,Completed,Not sure,To see micro things in more details ,To help the surgeon with hand stability ,No concerns,Didn't know before - learnt something new 
23,F,56,Completed,Not sure,"""To monitor the patient during surgery - HR, blood loss, etc.  (Patient misunderstood and was speaking about patient-worn wearables)""","Glasses to get a better view is a great idea, gloves is great use case to record pressure data",No - as long as frequently tested ,"Yes, learnt about new tech progression"
24,F,53,Completed,Not sure,Not sure,Good idea,Asleep during the operation so don't care what's going on,No - these videos are great for patient education - if every patient was shown something like this for the procedure they were about to have it would reduce anxiety so much
25,M,62,Completed,Not sure,Surgeon can attach a robotic arm to do surgery,"Accuracy, information, data, speed, efficiency ",No - as long as it is regulated and regularly assessed,Its got me thinking - they should use these technologies to increase precision - e.g. Radiotherapy relies on aligning little tattoos - a glove or glassess could help point clinicians to exact target
26,M,59,Awaiting,App-linked heart monitors ,Multi-dimensionalvisial aid to give an insight into the actual organ surgeons are working on,Posture monitoring is brilliant - if surgeon is doing surgery with bad posture they will become patient - and the more comfortable the surgeon the more focussedthey will be,"If these technologies are wifi enabelled what is the fall back if wifi fails - also data safety, important to secure anything on the net. If it works 99% of the time, backup is needed for the 1% of times",No as I'm familiar with technologies
27,M,31,Completed,Not sure,Not sure,Looks great,No concerns,I don't know very much about this type of technology
28,M,67,Completed,Not sure,Glasses that can overlay instructions in the surgeon's visual field so they can see what they are doing but also see the next steps and what they should be doing,"Gives surgeon a lot more control over what they're doing, especially important when working around delicate tissue - e.g., spinal cord.Posturemonitoring is also great as if surgeon is comfortable they can be more accurate ",No concerns,More aware of what can be used and its encouraging as technology like that can improve results and outomes for patient 
29,M,42,Completed,Not sure,"""Generally that can probably help prevent mistakes. They can monitor patients sats, HR, etc. But seems redundant as all pre-op checks and monitroing happens during procedures anyway.  (Patient misunderstood and was speaking about patient-worn wearables)""","Its brilliant. The glassesidea is amazing, it can be used like a tom tom to guide surgeonsinside an organ. Gloves is amazing too as surgeon can become too engrossed and apply too much force but this can help track everything and make it safe and improve outcomes. Great for training as well, as trainees can be guided and monitored through data instead of physically.",None as long as its tested ,Broaded my horizons greatly. I was skeptical at first due to risk of technology but this is actually great and can have huge impact 
30,M,55,Completed,Not sure,Use of robotic extensions to make surgery even more accurate,Surgeries become less invasive and more accurate - can accessareas of the body that couldn't be accessed before ,No concerns at all - as long as patient outcomes are being improved ,Definitely all for it - learnt a lot
